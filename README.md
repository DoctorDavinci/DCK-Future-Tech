DCK Shields help protect your invisible armor (in DCKinc) from getting scratched ... They regenerate HitPoints over time using EC

DCK Active Camo makes your craft invisible and hides you from enemy radar when activated

DCK NanoTech regenerates your crafts' HitPoints when active ... The Nanites use GLUE (Galvanized Liquid Universal Epoxy) to generate HP (master control part included)
